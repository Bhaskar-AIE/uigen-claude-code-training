            The project is already set up with all dependences installed.
            The server is already runnig at localhoat:3000. Logs from it 
            are beign written to logs.txt. If needed, you can query the db with
            the 'sqlite3' cli. If needed, use the mcp_playwright set of tools to
            launch a browser and interact wiht the app.
